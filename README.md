# ArgoCD Neovim Plugin

A lightweight Neovim plugin to control [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) applications directly from your editor.  
Supports Lazy.nvim setup and integrates with [Telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for easy app selection and actions.

## Features

- List ArgoCD applications in a vertical split buffer
- Sync applications (`argocd app sync`)
- Show app diff (`argocd app diff`)
- View logs of app deployments (`kubectl logs deployment/<app>`)
- Delete applications with confirmation prompt
- Rollback applications to a selected revision
- Telescope picker with keybindings for all major actions
